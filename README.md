Hello Dan, This is Divya Chainani. My number is :- A00432519 and Email is :- divya.chainani@smu.ca. I completed my graduation in 2016 and have a work experience of 2.5 yrs in SAP BODS with IBM. I am very much interested in Databases and Data analysis. I really enjoy coding and anything related to it. In my work experience, I did a bit of scripting (coding) in python. I really liked today's class specially the bit of SDLC models as I am familiar with both the models discussed in the class(Waterfall and Agile) so it was easy to understand the things a bit more and interesting.
